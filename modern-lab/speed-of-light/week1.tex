Hand in your responses to these questions at the end of lab today.  Please email me either an electronic file or a legible photo/scan of a handwritten page(s).  Each person should hand in their own.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item A car drives from Albany, NY to New York City, traveling 154 miles in 2 hours and 34 minutes. What
        is the average speed of the car in miles per hour (mph)? In kilometers per hour (km/h)? In meters per second (m/s)? 

    \item How fast can you run? Give your answer in meters per second and in miles per hour? How fast was 
        Usain Bolt?

    \item What is the fastest object humanity has ever devised? Give your answer in both mph and m/s.

    \item How fast does a point on the Earth's surface move at the equator (m/s)? How fast is the Earth traveling
        around the sun (m/s)?

    \item If a plane was traveling at 10x the speed of sound, how long would it take to go around the Earth at 
        the equator?

    \item An athlete is training by running as fast as they can between two markers placed 20 meters
        apart. They are moving at 3.5 m/s, on average and they go back and and forth between the two 
        markers 12 times. How long does it take them? 

   \item Suppose the markers are 21 meters apart. How long does it take the athlete to do the 12 repetitions,
       assuming they still move at 3.5 m/s?

   \item A bumblebee flaps its wings about 200 times per second. What is this rate in Hertz (Hz)? How many times
       does a bumblebee flap its wings in 1 minute? What is the length of time between each flap?
