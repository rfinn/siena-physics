Hand in your responses to these questions at the end of lab today. Each person should hand in their own.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Review the concepts of the double-slit interference pattern. Draw a sketch of this setup and
    all relevant quantities that you would want to measure. How would you explain the pattern that appears on the 
        viewing screen?

\item Suppose you have two narrow slits separated by distance $d$. A viewing screen is distance $L$ away. If you are
using light of wavelength $\lambda$, what is the separation between the might spot in the middle of
the viewing screen and the first maximum on one side? If you use light of a smaller wavelength, does
the separation get larger or smaller?

\item If you have an electron accelerated from rest across a 1 V potential difference, what is it's deBroglie wavelength? 
What about a 1000 V potential difference?

\end{enumerate}
