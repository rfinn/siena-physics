Hand in your responses to these questions at the end of lab today. Each person should hand in their own.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Consider two waves of equal wavelength $\lambda$ that originate from 
different sources but meet at the same point.
If the waves are perfectly {\it in phase}, what behavior do you expect where the waves meet?
What does it mean if they are {\it in phase}? Draw any pictures you need to explain this process.

\item Consider the same two waves and assume that they start out in phase at their respective
points of origin. If one wave travels a longer distance $\Delta L$ such that $\Delta L = \lambda$
What do you expect when the waves meet? What about for the following scenarios?
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,topsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item $\Delta L = \frac{1}{2}\lambda$
    \item $\Delta L = \frac{3}{2}\lambda$
    \item $\Delta L = 3\lambda$
    \item $\Delta L = 978\lambda$
    \item $\Delta L = \frac{2}{5}\lambda$
    \item $\Delta L = 1.769\lambda$
\end{itemize}

\item Review the concepts of the double-slit interference pattern. Draw a sketch of this setup and
all relevant quantities that you would want to measure. How would you explain the pattern that appears on the 
viewing screen?

viewing screen?

\item Suppose you have two narrow slits separated by distance $d$. A viewing screen is distance $L$ away. If you are
using light of wavelength $\lambda$, what is the separation between the might spot in the middle of
the viewing screen and the first maximum on one side? If you use light of a smaller wavelength, does
the separation get larger or smaller?

\item If you have an electron accelerated from rest across a 1 V potential difference, what is it's deBroglie wavelength? 
What about a 1000 V potential difference?

\item What is the difference between the arrangement of atoms in a crystal versus a glass or plastic?

\item In a crystal, what is the average spacing between atoms? This will vary from material to material 
so give a rough answer. 

\item To what energy would you need to accelerate electrons such that their wavelength was equal to
what you estimate for the atomic spacings in a crystal?

\end{enumerate}
